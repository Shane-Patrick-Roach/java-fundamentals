# Linter

---

## Feature Task 1

- Write a method that reads a JS file with a given PATH. generates error messages whenever it fins lines that done end with a semi colon.


## The linter should not give an error message for the following.

- Don’t show an error if the line is empty.
- Don’t show an error if the line ends with an opening curly brace {
- Don’t show an error if the line ends with an closing curly brace }
- Don’t show an error if the line contains if or else

## Change Log:

### 2/16/21

- WIP added structure of code but not able to access correct file path. Will ask for help in lab tomorrow.


### 2/20/21

- Finished Lab. Could not get test to work on empty file. Something was happening within code that would not produce the deried error output.
